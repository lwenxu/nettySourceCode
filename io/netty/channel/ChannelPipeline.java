/**
 * A list of {@link ChannelHandler}s which handles or intercepts inbound events and outbound operations of a
 * {@link Channel}.  {@link ChannelPipeline} implements an advanced form of the
 * <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/interceptingfilter-142169.html">Intercepting Filter</a> pattern
 * to give a user full control over how an event is handled and how the {@link ChannelHandler}s in a pipeline
 * interact with each other.
 *
 * <h3>Creation of a pipeline</h3>
 *
 * Each channel has its own pipeline and it is created automatically when a new channel is created.
 *
 * <h3>How an event flows in a pipeline</h3>
 *
 * The following diagram describes how I/O events are processed by {@link ChannelHandler}s in a {@link ChannelPipeline}
 * typically. An I/O event is handled by either a {@link ChannelInboundHandler} or a {@link ChannelOutboundHandler}
 * and be forwarded to its closest handler by calling the event propagation methods defined in
 * {@link ChannelHandlerContext}, such as {@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelRead(Object)} and
 * {@link ChannelHandlerContext#write(Object)}.
 *
 * <pre>
 *                                                 I/O Request
 *                                            via {@link Channel} or
 *                                        {@link ChannelHandlerContext}

 *  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
 * </pre>
 * An inbound event is handled by the inbound handlers in the bottom-up direction as shown on the left side of the
 * diagram.  An inbound handler usually handles the inbound data generated by the I/O thread on the bottom of the
 * diagram.  The inbound data is often read from a remote peer via the actual input operation such as
 * {@link SocketChannel#read(ByteBuffer)}.  If an inbound event goes beyond the top inbound handler, it is discarded
 * silently, or logged if it needs your attention.
 * <p>
 * An outbound event is handled by the outbound handler in the top-down direction as shown on the right side of the
 * diagram.  An outbound handler usually generates or transforms the outbound traffic such as write requests.
 * If an outbound event goes beyond the bottom outbound handler, it is handled by an I/O thread associated with the
 * {@link Channel}. The I/O thread often performs the actual output operation such as
 * {@link SocketChannel#write(ByteBuffer)}.
 * <p>
 * For example, let us assume that we created the following pipeline:
 * <pre>
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} p = ...;
 * p.addLast("1", new InboundHandlerA());
 * p.addLast("2", new InboundHandlerB());
 * p.addLast("3", new OutboundHandlerA());
 * p.addLast("4", new OutboundHandlerB());
 * p.addLast("5", new InboundOutboundHandlerX());
 * </pre>
 * In the example above, the class whose name starts with {@code Inbound} means it is an inbound handler.
 * The class whose name starts with {@code Outbound} means it is a outbound handler.
 * <p>
 * In the given example configuration, the handler evaluation order is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 when an event goes inbound.
 * When an event goes outbound, the order is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  On top of this principle, {@link ChannelPipeline} skips
 * the evaluation of certain handlers to shorten the stack depth:
 * <ul>
 * <li>3 and 4 don't implement {@link ChannelInboundHandler}, and therefore the actual evaluation order of an inbound
 *     event will be: 1, 2, and 5.</li>
 * <li>1 and 2 don't implement {@link ChannelOutboundHandler}, and therefore the actual evaluation order of a
 *     outbound event will be: 5, 4, and 3.</li>
 * <li>If 5 implements both {@link ChannelInboundHandler} and {@link ChannelOutboundHandler}, the evaluation order of
 *     an inbound and a outbound event could be 125 and 543 respectively.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Forwarding an event to the next handler</h3>
 *
 * As you might noticed in the diagram shows, a handler has to invoke the event propagation methods in
 * {@link ChannelHandlerContext} to forward an event to its next handler.  Those methods include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Inbound event propagation methods:
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelRegistered()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelActive()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelRead(Object)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelReadComplete()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireExceptionCaught(Throwable)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireUserEventTriggered(Object)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelWritabilityChanged()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelInactive()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelUnregistered()}</li>
 *     </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>Outbound event propagation methods:
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#bind(SocketAddress, ChannelPromise)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#connect(SocketAddress, SocketAddress, ChannelPromise)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#write(Object, ChannelPromise)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#flush()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#read()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#disconnect(ChannelPromise)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#close(ChannelPromise)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#deregister(ChannelPromise)}</li>
 *     </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * and the following example shows how the event propagation is usually done:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyInboundHandler extends {@link ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter} {
 *     {@code @Override}
 *     public void channelActive({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx) {
 *         System.out.println("Connected!");
 *         ctx.fireChannelActive();
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * public clas MyOutboundHandler extends {@link ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter} {
 *     {@code @Override}
 *     public void close({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx, {@link ChannelPromise} promise) {
 *         System.out.println("Closing ..");
 *         ctx.close(promise);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Building a pipeline</h3>
 * <p>
 * A user is supposed to have one or more {@link ChannelHandler}s in a pipeline to receive I/O events (e.g. read) and
 * to request I/O operations (e.g. write and close).  For example, a typical server will have the following handlers
 * in each channel's pipeline, but your mileage may vary depending on the complexity and characteristics of the
 * protocol and business logic:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Protocol Decoder - translates binary data (e.g. {@link ByteBuf}) into a Java object.</li>
 * <li>Protocol Encoder - translates a Java object into binary data.</li>
 * <li>Business Logic Handler - performs the actual business logic (e.g. database access).</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * and it could be represented as shown in the following example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * static final {@link EventExecutorGroup} group = new {@link DefaultEventExecutorGroup}(16);
 * ...
 *
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} pipeline = ch.pipeline();
 *
 * pipeline.addLast("decoder", new MyProtocolDecoder());
 * pipeline.addLast("encoder", new MyProtocolEncoder());
 *
 * // Tell the pipeline to run MyBusinessLogicHandler's event handler methods
 * // in a different thread than an I/O thread so that the I/O thread is not blocked by
 * // a time-consuming task.
 * // If your business logic is fully asynchronous or finished very quickly, you don't
 * // need to specify a group.
 * pipeline.addLast(group, "handler", new MyBusinessLogicHandler());
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link ChannelHandler} can be added or removed at any time because a {@link ChannelPipeline} is thread safe.
 * For example, you can insert an encryption handler when sensitive information is about to be exchanged, and remove it
 * after the exchange.
